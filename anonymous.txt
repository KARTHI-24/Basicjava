1. anonymous object
     creating object without the refernce
     A obj=new A();
     obj is just the refernce not the object creation 
     new A();--->this is the object creation in the memory
     new A().show();-->using this we can call the method .this is called anonymous object 
     using we call only once that means to call another method we have to create object agian
     that is waste of memory .

2. dynamic method dispacth
     consider there is three class 
     class A 
     show();
     class B
     show();
     class C
     show();
     In above case we are overriding the show() methods 
     while creating the object we are keeping the refernce for A and creating object 
     for B and C class that is dynamic method dispacth
     example of creating object
     A obj=new A();
     obj.show();---->it will call A class show()
     obj=new B();
     obj.show();---->it will call B class show()
     obj=new c();
     obj.show();--->it will call C class show()
